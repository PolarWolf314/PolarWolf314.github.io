<h1>Tiki Photos!</h1>

<div>
    <p>This was on the day we got her the purple Frisbee, a long time ago.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/1_frisbee.JPG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>This is her playing around with my sister. She looks so crazy.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/2_crazy.PNG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>She loved laying down outside on the deck, and would always be ready to pose.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/3_pretty.PNG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>I taught her how to play dead, and she plays along most of the time...</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/4_demon.PNG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>This is after I brutally murdered her with my finger gun >:).</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/5_dead.PNG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>Tiki loves tennis balls and Frisbees, and this tennis ball used to squeak. Used to.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/6_ballFocus.PNG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>To quote my sister: "She looks like a male".</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/7_male.PNG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>You can't see in the photo, but I'm holding a tennis ball out of frame. She looks so sneaky.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/8_sneaky.PNG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>One time she jumped on my bed, and I didn't have the heart to tell her to get off, so for a while, she would sleep
    on my bed.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/9_bed.JPG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>This was her playing on the beach.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/10_beach.PNG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>We got a new fridge, and for a while the cardboard box that came with it was her favourite resting place.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/11_box.JPG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>During thunderstorms she gets really scared, so we get her on a bed and wrap her up with blankets.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/12_scared.JPG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>Yawn. Hehe.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/13_yawn.JPG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>She looks so stupid in this photo. I think I was playing with her, and she decided to look like she was on meth.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/14_meth.JPG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>A rare occasion where both her ears would perk up straight. She's such a fake German Shepherd.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/15_sayWhat.JPG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>Outside again, playing with a new Frisbee (which she ended up destroying over time).</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/16_frisbee.JPG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>My best friend decided to put some flowers on Tiki's head. This is my profile picture for a lot of sites.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/17_flower.JPG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>Best friend placing flowers on dog head in action.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/18_flowerFriend.JPG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>Around this time was when I got my new iPhone (12), and I was trying out some portrait mode photos.
    Needless to say, Tiki looks like a model.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/19_model.JPEG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>A photo from the same day, some more portrait mode photos :P.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/20_frisbeeModel.JPEG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>She likes to bask in the sun and recharge, although now we keep her inside because she always barks at strangers.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/21_sunbathing.JPEG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>Another modelling photo. I really like this one!</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/22_modelBack.JPEG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>Classic candid photo. She looks so pretty.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/23.frisbeeModel.JPEG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>She was about to fall asleep but then something caught her attention. Obviously, nothing is worth losing rest
    over, unless it's a cat. Silly dog.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/24_sleepy.JPEG" width="450" alt=""></div>
    <p>One of my favourite photos of her.</p>
    <div><img src="Tiki/25_beautiful.JPEG" width="450" alt=""></div>
