    <h2>Who is PolarWolf314?</h2>

        <p>
            My name is Aaron! I am currently a part 1 student, studying a BA/BE(hons) conjoint at the
            University of Auckland. Hopefully, I should be doing software engineering next year.

    <h2>Why did I make this page?</h2>

    <div>
        <p>
            Purely for interest, for fun, and for the sake of learning! I hope to be able to use this page to share
            notes and information, as well as learning web dev languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    <h2>How am I hosting this website?</h2>

    <div>
        <p>
            I am hosting this through GitHub pages, which allows you to host websites for free. The only
            catch is that it doesn't allow you to have your own domain, but all things considered, this is
            a great resource. You can find more information
            <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"> here</a>.
