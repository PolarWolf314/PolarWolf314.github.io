<h1>About Page</h1>

    <h2>Who is PolarWolf314?</h2>
    <div>
        My name is Aaron! I am currently a part 1 student, studying a BA/BE(hons) conjoint at the
        University of Auckland. Hopefully, I should be doing software engineering next year.

    <h2>Why did I make this page?</h2>
    <div>
        Purely for interest! I hope to be able to use this page to share notes and information, as well
        as learning web dev languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    <h2>How am I hosting this website?</h2>
    <div>
        I am hosting this through GitHub pages, which allows you to host websites for free. The only
        catch is that it doesn't allow you to have your own domain, but all things considered, this is
        a great resource. You can find more information
        <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"> here</a>.
